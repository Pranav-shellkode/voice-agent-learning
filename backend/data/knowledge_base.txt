Hi Shell‑koders, 👋
We’re excited to announce that Zoho People (ZPP) will officially launch on 27th Jan 2026. We’ll begin with Attendance and Leave tracking as the first step.

All employees will be assigned ZP access (activated by us), so you’ll start receiving mailers directly. Please take note of the following rules and timelines: 

Note: A detailed guideline document will be shared with you for easy reference.

⏰ Daily Check‑in & Check‑out (9:30 AM – 6:30 PM)
Missing this will be treated as unpaid leave. Please follow it diligently.
(Exceptions: Ex‑Cos, enabling function and field teams like Sales team, employees at client sites).

📧 Attendance Regularization & Leave Updates
Automated reminders will be sent in case you make a miss in updating any day or any leave.
📊 Leave Balance & Attendance Status
You can track this directly from your ZPP access—no manual intervention needed.

🛠️ Technical Glitches (Expected!)
In case of issues, highlight them in the Teams Group (to be created by tomorrow).

📅 Data Submission Deadline – 5th Feb 2026
All relevant employment details must be updated in the system by this date by every employee. Delays may result in your ZPP access being auto‑blocked.

👥 Applicability
This process applies to all employees (trainees and laterals).

Let’s embrace this change together—it’ll make our processes smoother, smarter, and more transparent. 🌟
